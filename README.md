It has been made for a project regarding the course 'Data for Heritage Collections' by professor Fred Truyen.
This course is part of the postgraduate degree in Cultural Heritage: digital transformation at Kuleuven.

In this readme I will give an overview of the different documents that can be found in the repository.
