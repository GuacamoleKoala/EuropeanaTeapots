# EuropeanaTeapots
This repository is created by Jenske Verhamme.
It has been made for a project regarding the course 'Data for Heritage Collections' by professor Fred Truyen.
This course is part of the postgraduate degree in Cultural Heritage: digital transformation at Kuleuven.

This project experiments with data scraping from Europeana via API and Python scripting.
Secondly, it experiments with cleaning and refining data in Openrefine and Excel
Thirdly, it experiments with visualisations in Tableau by making sheets and dashboards of the cleaned dataset
Lastly, it looks into IIIF and visualising the images of the dataset in Mirador viewer via HTML scripting.

In this readme I will give an overview of the different documents that can be found in the repository.

First of all I wrote a manual that documents the progress of this project.

Secondly, I added the first full dataset I was able to extract in Chapter one.

Next, I added the final cleaned dataset with the help of Excel and OpenRefine. I also added the project in OpenRefine.
I also added the data extract from Tableau. This dataset is based on the previous one, but in Tableau I made some extra adjustments
Next I added the visualisations in Tableau.

needs to be added:

dataset from script 1
dataset from script 2
any other datasets extracted
dataset from tableau.
